Smart glasses and, in general, eyewear are a relatively novel device class with a lot of possibilities for unobtrusive human-computer interaction, sensing, and even human computer integration.

We started a while back working in the team of Masahiko Inami Sensei at the time at Keio Media Design in collaborative
research with J!NS. This lead to the first unobtrusive sensing glasses, J!NS MEME.

I cover a lot of the initial research in early talks at the Chaos Communication Congress.  Here's the presentation about the concept of Eyewear Computing.

In addition, we also organized a [Dagstuhl Seminar](http://www.dagstuhl.de/16042) on the topic.
